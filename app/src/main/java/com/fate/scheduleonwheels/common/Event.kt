 * Used as a wrapper for timeSheetsSummaryData that is exposed via a LiveData that represents an event.

 * You need to specify the intention by using [getContentIfNotHandled] or [peekContent]
 * This method models the events as part of the state: theyâ€™re now simply a message that has been consumed or not.
